Constant Buffers

Vertex Buffers
c0 = (engine-rare) rare to change data
c1 = (engine-frame) set for groups of objects (view matrix, lights )
c2 = (engine-object/instance) set per object (world matrix)
c3-c4 = reserved
c5 = (application-rare) defined globals (application changes only as needed)
c6 = (application-frame)
c7 = (application-object)
